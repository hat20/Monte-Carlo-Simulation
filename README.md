# Monte-Carlo-Simulation

<b> WORK IN PROGRESS! </b>

Studied Monte Carlo Simulation for the first time today in my Project Management class and felt the urge to code it and so 
here it is, I would be updating it and adding more features to it from time to time. Stay Tuned 

For running this program just follow what the program asks you to do.

<b> Steps for running this code: </b>
<i>In WINDOWS</i>
- First you need to find the address of where the jdk is installed in your pc. It would probably be stored in a location like this "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.1\bin" or
  "WindowsDrive:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.1\bin". You need to copy the address.
- Now, open CMD and write "path= C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.1\bin" or "path= paste what you copied" which sets the path temporarily. You need to do this everytime you need to run Java programs on your PC.
- Type <b>javac</b> to check whether you were able to set the path without any errors, if you were then proceed to the next step otherwise repeat the above step and make sure that you followed it correctly.
- Make sure that you change your current directory to where your programs are stored. If you don't know how to do it then simply paste the programs on Desktop and type "cd Desktop" on CMD.
- To run the program, type <b>javac filename.java</b> then after it compiles successfully type <b>java filename</b> to run the class and see the output.
- That's it, enjoy!

<i>In Ubuntu 16.04LTS</i>
- Just change your current directory to where your programs are stored. If you don't know how to do it then simply paste the programs on Desktop and type "cd Desktop" on Terminal.
- To run the program, type <b>javac filename.java</b> then after it compiles successfully type <b>java filename</b> to run the class and see the output.
- That's it, enjoy!
